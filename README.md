## What i learned?
- Basic concepts how to style static page with tailwind CSS.
- Learned how to create Next.js project and host it to Vercel.
## My opinions of these technologies
Next.js project was easy to create and hosting this page to Vercel was effortless. I will deffinetly use Next for my future projects. You dont even need to do npm run build. Just pushing the code to Github and Vercel will update the changes automaticly.<br> <br>
Tailwind was simple to use, but adding it to my Next.js project took littlebit of time to setup correctly. But overall Tailwind was fun and simple to use once you have experience with plain CSS.
